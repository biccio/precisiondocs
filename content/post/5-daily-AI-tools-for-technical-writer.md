If you work as a technical writer, you know that your days are filled with API references, knowledge bases, release notes, UX copy, and the occasional Git-based headache. But what today can make a huge difference in keeping the work consistent and scalable it’s **a curated stack of AI tools**, each chosen for one thing they do really well.

Here are the five AI-powered tools you can rely on **every single day**.

## 1. [Document360](https://document360.com) + AI Assist

### For: Knowledge base creation and intelligent article linking

Document360 is one of the best all-in-one platforms for building product knowledge bases. The AI Assist feature helps:

- Autocomplete sections based on existing documentation
- Suggest related topics and link them automatically
- Generate FAQs directly from the article content

It’s context-aware and tuned for docs, not generic blog writing. It's very useful especially for clients that publish **public-facing help centers** or need **internal knowledge hubs** for support teams.

## 2. [Writer.com](https://writer.com)

### For: Style guide enforcement at scale

If you're writing for multiple clients, each with their tone of voice, glossary, and compliance needs, Writer is a lifesaver. It acts like a Grammarly on steroids—specifically built for **teams, tech, and enterprise writing**.

It:

- Flags inconsistent terminology and voice violations
- Offers real-time suggestions based on a custom style guide
- Helps maintain inclusive, accessible language

Perfect for when you'are co-writing with devs, PMs, or other writers—**everyone stays aligned**.

## 3. [ReadMe](https://readme.com) + AI Reference Generator

### For: API reference generation and OpenAPI augmentation

I work a lot with OpenAPI files, and ReadMe is built around that. Their AI auto-generates:

- Descriptions of endpoints based on schema names
- Sample requests and responses
- Parameter and response tables with real docs structure

It even tells you when something is missing from your spec. Ideal for teams that **don’t have time to write docs by hand**, but still want high-quality developer experience.

## 4. ChatGPT (Custom GPTs + Local Knowledge Base)

### For: Fast rewriting, explanation, and tone adaptation

Yes, the classic ChatGPT we all know can become a real powerhouse when used with custom GPTs and your local knowledge base.

- Client-specific style guides
- Project glossaries
- OpenAPI specs and markdown repos

Then you can use it for:

- Rewriting dense dev notes into clear prose
- Switching tone from "dev to PM" or "dev to end-user"
- Auto-generating edge case examples or intro blurbs

---

## 5. [Typo](https://typowriter.ai)

### For: Clean, consistent changelogs from GitHub commits

Typo is a tool that **reads your Git commits and PRs**, and writes clear, structured release notes. What I love:

- It uses semantic commit messages and turns them into human-friendly changelogs
- It formats notes based on templates (Markdown, HTML, etc.)
- It even suggests section titles and tags (Fix, Feature, Deprecation)

Release notes go from a painful back-and-forth with devs to a 2-minute job.

### Why you should not use a "One-Tool-To-Rule-Them-All"

The truth is: **general-purpose AI doesn’t cut it** for technical documentation. I’ve tested the all-in-one writing tools, and they tend to fall apart when structure, traceability, or compliance matters.

The tools above aren’t writing _for_ me—they’re helping me write **better, faster, more consistently**, with the right level of control, and this really is what AI should be about!
