Hello there 👋🏻

My name is [Fabrizio Ulisse](https://linkedin.com/in/ulisse), I spent 25+ years in various roles 
I have a 25+y information architecture, interaction design and process design background, mostly in streaming video web projects. I spent all my work life in digital agencies (including my own), simplifying and humanizing tech complexities. 

Now I'm Senior Tech Communication officer @[PagoPA](https://pagopa.it) (Italy). 

I love travelling with my gravel bike, and playing rock blues with my Fender Stratocaster. Most importantly, I'm a father.
