Hello there 👋🏻

My name is [Fabrizio Ulisse](https://linkedin.com/in/fabrizioulisse)

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Senior Tech Communication Officer @[PagoPA](https://pagopa.it)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

I come from an **information architecture**, **interaction design** and **project management** background, mostly in streaming video web projects. Now I'm Senior Tech Communication @[PagoPA](https://pagopa.it) (Italy). I spent all my work life in digital agencies, simplifying and humanizing tech complexities. 

I love travelling with my gravel bike (and I run a [blog about my trips](https://ciclogravelista.com)), and playing rock blues with my Fender Stratocaster. Most importantly, I'm a father.
