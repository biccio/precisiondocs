Hello there 👋🏻

My name is [Fabrizio Ulisse](https://fabrizioulisse.it) and this is my blog about Tech Writing.

- I’m currently working as Senior Tech Communication Officer @[PagoPA](https://pagopa.it)
- Pronouns: he/him
- You can find me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/fabrizioulisse) and [Github](https://github.com/biccio)

I come from an **information architecture**, **interaction design** and **project management** background, mostly in streaming video web projects. Now I'm employed as Senior Tech Communication @[PagoPA](https://pagopa.it) (Italy). I spent all my work life in digital agencies, simplifying and humanizing tech complexities. 

I love travelling with my gravel bike (and I run a [blog about my trips](https://ciclogravelista.com)), and [playing my Fender Stratocaster](https://youtu.be/_505xUKLlAo). 

Most importantly, I'm a father.
