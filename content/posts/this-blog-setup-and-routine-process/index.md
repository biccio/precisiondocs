## Introduction
Static site generation is a very popular solution in today's publishing environments, especially for technical documentation. The available frameworks are solid and easy to use, and the resulting website is blazing fast with no hiccups and zero render time. If you add Github to the workflow as a storage solution, and Netlify as deployment framework, you have a perfect solution to a fast and clean publishing process.
In this article, I'll describe all the steps I've taken to bring Precisiondocs online, and how I maintain the content in my publishing process.

## Framework: Hugo
As static site generator, I went for Hugo. It's a solid framework, with good themes, and it's based on markdown files organized in a simple file system. To install the Hugo framework, you need to start by setting up Hugo on your machine. You can install Hugo via a package manager or download it directly

Here is a step-by-step guide to installing the Hugo framework, creating a new website, and installing the Anubis2 theme, the one I chose for this website
### Step 1: Install Hugo

For **macOS**:

```bash
brew install hugo
```

For **Linux**:

```bash
sudo apt-get install hugo
```

For **Windows**:
Download the binary from the [Hugo GitHub releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and add it to your PATH.

Once Hugo is installed, check if itâ€™s working correctly by running:

```bash
hugo version
```

### Step 2: Create a New Website
Now that you installed Hugo, you need to create a new Hugo site by running the following command:

```bash
hugo new site my-website
```

This command will create a new folder `my-website` with the necessary Hugo folder structure.
At this point, you may want to move into the newly created website folder:

```bash
cd my-website
```

### Step 3: Install the Anubis2 Theme
In any Hugo installation you will need to add a *theme* to provide a layout and a presentation layer  to your content. In my case I chose Anubis2. You can install this theme (as any other) using Git. Run the following command to add it as a submodule:
```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis.git themes/anubis2
```

Now that the theme is installed, you will need to let Hugo know. Look in the root for a file called `config.toml` file and add the following line to specify the Anubis2 theme:

```toml
theme = "anubis2"
```

Now you' re ready to launch the website using this command:

```bash
hugo server
```
   
   This will make your site available at `http://localhost:1313`. Hugo will automatically rebuild
## Repository: Github
Once your site is ready, you may want to create a repository on Github and put your website in it. This way you'll be able to easily push updates online, and - as we'll see - deploy the content.
First of all, you will create a repository on Github from your profile page, giving it a name of your choice and deciding for it to be ```public``` or ```private```. Then you'll go back to your terminal and initialize ```git``` using the commands provided from Github to connect your local repo to the online counterpart. 

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/biccio/prova.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Now you're all set! Let's go to Netlify
